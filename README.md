# FAQ-accordion-card

project done entirely by me, idea taken from www.frontendmentor.io

# How it works?

FAQ works in the way that single answers appear when you click, if you click on the first question you will get the answer to it, and if another was already active, it will be wrapped up

# What have I learned in this project?

I practiced using bootstrap in this project, so that the site would be more interactive without using Javascript. I also learned how to read technical documentation
